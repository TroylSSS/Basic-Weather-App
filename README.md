I have no idea what I'm doing, still trying to figure things out on my own. 
I'm still new to coding and stuff, learning in my own pace.
That's code from the video: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix9cRaBkVe0" (Not the entire code, I was too lazy to follow about the emoji and stuff.)
I would like to add more like an icon, show current time, humidity, wind and pressure. If I could.
